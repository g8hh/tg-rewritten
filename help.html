		<h3>Help, what Rebirth Upgrades do I go for?</h3>
		<p>Focus on upgrades in this order:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Better RP</li>
			<li>"Buff" upgrades</li>
			<li>Static RP</li>
			<li>Dynamic/Static y</li>
			<li>Dynamic/Static x+z</li>
			<li>Cheaper Upgrades</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>
			I've unlocked the next set of rebirth upgrades, what should I do?
		</h3>
		<p>
			This part is actually a little strange. You can go through the first
			part of the tree like normal, but when you reach "More Upgrades",
			<b>Don't buy it until you can afford the upgrade after it!</b>
			<br />
			Most other progression can be made via messing around. Note; it's
			not always optimal to have as many levels of Exponential y as you
			can afford.
		</p>
		<h3>Ughh, this feels like a timewall!</h3>
		<p>Timewalls are almost nonexistent in Tree Game. Either</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				You're at endgame for now. Good job! Please be patient while I
				add more content.
			</li>
			<li>
				There's a better strategy. Try respeccing your Rebirth Tree.
			</li>
			<li>
				The game is just a little slow there- you'll probably be able to
				progress in a few minutes.
			</li>
		</ol>
